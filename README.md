This collection of data is part of the RNA-Seq (HiSeq) PANCAN data set, it is a random extraction of gene expressions of patients having different types of tumor: BRCA, KIRC, COAD, LUAD and PRAD.

# Additional Information

Samples (instances) are stored row-wise. Variables (attributes) of each sample are RNA-Seq gene expression levels measured by illumina HiSeq platform.

# Variable Information

A dummy name (gene_XX) is given to each attribute. Check the original submission (https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn4301332), or the platform specs for the complete list of probes name. The attributes are ordered consitently with the original submission.
